# Final Project – Behavior Tree Node

This project implements a Behavior Tree node for autonomous robot control within a ROS2-based framework.

## Objectives

- Implement autonomous behavior logic.
- Integrate perception, mapping, and planning modules.
- Use a structured Behavior Tree architecture.

## Implementation

The node:
- Processes ROS2 messages.
- Interacts with mapping and planning components.
- Executes actions based on the Behavior Tree structure.

The implementation is written in Python and follows ROS2 conventions.
