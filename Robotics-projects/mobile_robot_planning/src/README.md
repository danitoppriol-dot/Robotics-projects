Academic robotics assignments: TurtleBot navigation, robotic arm inverse kinematics, occupancy grid mapping, and path planning.


# Introductory Robotics Assignments

This repository contains academic assignments for an introductory robotics course. 
The projects cover mobile robot navigation, manipulator kinematics, and environment mapping.

## Projects

### 1. Robotic Arm Kinematics
- Forward and inverse kinematics for SCARA and KUKA manipulators
- Jacobian-based methods for solving joint configurations
- Language: Python
- Focus: Workspace computation, numerical IK, joint control

### 2. Mobile Robot Path Planning
- Motion planning for a Dubins-car-like robot
- A*-style search with collision checking
- Language: Python
- Focus: Trajectory generation, obstacle avoidance, simple car dynamics

### 3. Occupancy Grid Mapping
- 2D probabilistic mapping from simulated laser scans
- Ray tracing and occupancy update
- Free, occupied, and inflated (C-space) cells management
- Language: Python
- Focus: Grid map representation, sensor integration, environment reconstruction

## Tools & Libraries
- Python 3
- NumPy
- Optional ROS-style messages for mapping
- Visualization via Matplotlib / RViz (if ROS used)

## Usage
Each project folder contains source code, example scripts, and instructions. 
Run the scripts to reproduce simulations, plots, or map updates.
